# beNFT


beNFT offers a dApp that connects NGOs and philanthropic organizations with people around the world who want to contribute. In beNFT, organizations can sell collections of NFTs to interested contributors as a means of fundraising.

For organizations, we offer an NFT production service, in the case of lack of time and resources to allocate towards this. They can also consult a dedicated dashboard to keep up with their campaigns and funds raised.

beNFT on blockchain, allowing for fast transactions. Contributors that buy the NFTs will be helping a good cause AND getting an investment souvenir that can be used to spread awareness for the cause and influence more people to contribute. Furthermore, every time the NFT is resold, the organization gets a percentage over the resale price.

beNFT, marketing NFTs for good causes!
